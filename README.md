# A Test-Time Learning Approach to Reparameterize the Geophysical Inverse Problem with a Convolutional Neural Network (DIP-Inv)
## Summary
We proposed a method that doesnâ€™t require a training dataset of the subsurface models. This test-time learning method, where the CNN weights are adjusted for each test data, produces better inversion results in multiple synthetic cases. 
In this study, we examine the applicability of the implicit regularization from the CNN structure to Tikhonov-style geophysical inversions. The CNN maps an arbitrary vector to the model space (e.g., log-conductivity on the simulation mesh). 
The predicted subsurface model is then fed into a forward numerical simulation process to generate corresponding predicted measurements. 
Subsequently, the objective function value is computed by comparing these predicted measurements with the observed field measurements. 
The backpropagation algorithm is employed to update the trainable parameters of the CNN. 
Note that the CNN in our proposed method does not require training before the inversion, rather, the CNN weights are estimated in the inversion algorithm.

## Contents
There are 2 notebooks in the 'notebooks' directory:
- Generate_Synthetic_Voltages.ipynb: runs the forward simulation for the 5 cases shown in the paper. 5% Gaussion noises are added to the synthetic data. 
- Plot_Results.ipynb: gives an example about how to plot the image in the paper using SimPEG and matplotlib.
All notesbook can be run on Colab (!pip install is included in the first cell).

There are 2 python scripts in the 'train' directory:
- stage_1.py: trains a randomly initialized CNN with the lose |m-m_ref|. This stage is mainly for saving time in the experiments with the same reference model.
- train.py: using PyTorch as the deep learning frame and SimPEG for the forward simulations (details on how we connect them can be found in our paper). 
The final results (both the final predicted conductivity model and the weights) will be stored in the proper format with name defined in 'file_name' in the attributes dictionary.
